Podcast (prueba t√©cnica)

This is a showcase of a frontend concept made for a podcast app.

Project Status

This project is currently in development. The filter is working, the podcast dashboard is stored in localStorage and it only asks to fetch the data after 24h. However, due to lack of time, the information for the podcast detail is not stored and is being asked in each re-render.
The detail of each episode is not working, seems like the id of the episode is not well defined on the document so instead, I hardcoded a design for it, that being said, the implementation would be quite simple once the endpoint is clear.
